# Na√Øve-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm. Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.

In this notebook, the following steps are performed:

1. Testing digits classification on the MNIST dataset, using Bernoulli Naive Bayes (a generative model).
2. Classifying the "20 newsgroups" data set using self-implementation of Naive Bayes classifier and compare to the scikit learn built in version.

The notebook is based on '20 newsgroups', and 'MNIST' datasets from Kaggle, and was developed using Python.
