# Na√Øve-Bayes-Classifier
Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm. Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.

In this Notebook, I will perform:

1. Testing digits classification on the MNIST dataset, using Bernoulli Naive Bayes (a generative model).
2. Classifying the "20 newsgroups" data set using my own naive bayes classifier and compare to the scikit learn built in version.

This notebook based on '20 newsgroups', and 'MNIST' datasets from Kaggle.
